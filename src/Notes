reading of pH7 buffer == STDDev: 0.91 | trimMeanMedi: 617.00
Values are high bounds. Though, buffer7 seems to be toward low bound.
Pump delivers about 10-11mL pr 10sec


Process:
    Get tap water
    Measure pH with other meter
    Titrate slowly until the other meter stabilizes at the next value
    "log" -> "prev" to reset totalTitTime
    slowly titrate through the current pH value.
    Once stable at next .1 increment, take note of the used titSolAmmount
    Reset once more and start titration 


Notes:
    titTimes above 100ms are to be preffered, as the volume seems more consistent that this level. (below 50 appears to not produce any fluid)
        only use 40-50 if really really really really really small ammounts
        totalTitTime to Volume should not be trusted at low ms/doses. Use times above 50ms for more than a drop.
        minTitTime for a 6v pump run a 5v1a psu should be run for atleast 100ms per titPump

    1L tap water, 50-100mL diluted acid.
    current acid dil = 200g citric acid granulate -> 1 liter acid. 14 mL acid into 400mL dil acid
        currently using 450-500ms pumptimes to move pH .1 increment
    Really be sure to let the ref meter sit and mull over the correct value, and remember to stir the watera bit to get it mixed properly
    stand deviations at or 1-1.25 is preffered

    see if you can potentially find a titTime where you alter trimMeanMedi ADC by 1 per X.

    Be mindfull that the probes might interfere with one anothers readings if too close. Use a properly sized container.
    
    Personal observation, you can generally titrate another time once you see your ref Meter jump up .1, since it tends to calibrate upwards after stirring. Yours may differ, be curious.
        Another thing, mine seems to briefly blink to the increment one further down than the one where it settles after having stirred it when getting close to the bound.
        stirring at a bound seems to also trigger the lower than settling val

    respect the titCD before logging, your value might change! :O

    THIS DOES NOT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION:
        temps, other than what your module/sensorm might have on it.
